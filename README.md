## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into the following sections:

1. Data Understanding and Exploration: This phase involves loading the dataset, exploring the data to understand its characteristics, checking for missing values, and gaining insights into the distribution of variables.

2. Data Cleaning: In this step, we handle missing values, remove redundant variables, and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and consistency.

3. Feature Engineering: Here, we create new features or transform existing ones to improve the predictive power of our models.

4. Model Building: In this phase, we build machine learning models to predict customer churn. We experiment with various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.

5. Model Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps us select the best-performing model for deployment.

6. Deployment: Once the best model is selected, we deploy it to make predictions on new data or integrate it into existing business processes.

7. Conclusion and Recommendations: Finally, we summarize our findings, draw conclusions, and provide recommendations for stakeholders based on the insights gained from the analysis.
